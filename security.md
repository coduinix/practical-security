## DevOps
<img class='stretch' src='/images/pixabay/server-1235959_1280.jpg'/>

Note:
* Combine software development and operations
* Not all companies do DevOps
* A lot do
* One of the goals: eliminate handover and distinct responsibilities

### Deployments
<img class='stretch' src='/images/pixabay/notfound.jpg'/>

Note:
* From couple times per year
* To multiple times per day
* Continuous deployment 
* How do we make sure our apps and landscape are secure?
* We can't have the traditional tollgate which is called 'Security'

### DevSecOps / SecDevOps
<img class='stretch' src='/images/pixabay/notfound.jpg'/>

Note:
* Incorporate security in the DevOps way of working
* As developer I know that naming is hard
* In this case I don't think it's in the name, it's about making it work
* Security first sounds good

### BizArchSecDevTestOps? 
<!-- .element: class="no-caps" -->

Note:
* And how about business... and testing?
* Before you know it looks like 'waterfall' process in one camelcased
* Lets focus on Security today and less on naming

### No Silver Bullet
* People
* Processes
* Tools

Note:
* Not the silver bullet, but the only slide with bullets on it.
* Integrate in whole software development lifecycle
* Touches people, processes, tools
