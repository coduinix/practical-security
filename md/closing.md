## Embrace DevOps
* Reduce time-to-repair for vulnerabilities
* More ways to detect attackers 

Note:
* DevOps are used to deploy often
* All machinery is in place to immediately deploy a release
* Don't need special ops procedures
* DevOps teams will know how normal behavior of the app looks like
* Could help detecting anamolies

===

## Be aware
* Awareness is key
* You _will_ be a target

Note:
* Some day you will be target
* Directly or as stepping stone
* What might be the thing they're looking for
* Don't lean relax because you have implemented a login

===

## Don't over do
* Threat model
* Prevent alert fatigue

Note:
* Sounds like a contradiction
* Don't protect cookies with a vault
* But do think about security
* Tough to balance
* To much false positives will cause people to workaround instead of valuing alerts

===

## Questions
* Which questions do you have?
* Just ask:
  * In person
  * Via Twitter - [@coduinix](https://twitter.com/coduinix)

Note:
* I'll be around after talk
